## About the Project


### Overview
According to a recent study carried out by BMJ Quality and Safety, 12 million adults who seek medical care are misdiagnosed each year in the United States. The accumulation of large caseloads and incomplete medical histories leads to a rise in human errors. An artificial intelligence system can predict and diagnose a disease faster and more efficiently than medical professionals. In the following project, we will be predicting diseases from symptoms using machine learning algorithms like decision trees and random forests. Moreover, we will try to plot the diseases and symptoms and create a network graph to analyze the common symptoms between diseases, most common symptoms, most common diseases, etc.

### Built With
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook

## Dataset
Source: Disease-Symptom Knowledge Database
The dataset consists of 148 diseases with their corresponding symptoms. The dataset also included the count of disease occurrences.
